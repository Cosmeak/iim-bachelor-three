# Pygame learning
A repository of all game is "create" to learn thge pygame libray.

Have fun !


## First game tentavive: agar.io
I wanted to recreate the game [agar.io](https://agar.io/#ffa) from myself, but i encountered some difficulties because i not really know pygame at the first time. 

So actually the game board is printed, my player can "move" and eat some cells but the movement didn't really follow the mouse, the problem is from the equation i do for that.

I give up the projet to learn from scratch and with the pygame doc and multiple tutorial... That the second folder.

N.B.: Inside agario folder you will find all other informations about the project.



## Second game: PacMan
Inside this folder you will find all informations concerning this projet and what i used to document and help myself.


### Have a great correction! :)
